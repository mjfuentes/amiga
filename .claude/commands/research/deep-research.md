Conduct comprehensive research on: {{TOPIC}}

Use the research_agent with the following prompt:

"Perform comprehensive research on: {{TOPIC}}

Execute parallel searches:
1. Current best practices and industry standards
2. Implementation patterns in our codebase
3. Common pitfalls and security considerations
4. Performance implications and optimization strategies
5. Future trends and emerging patterns

Synthesize findings into:
- Executive summary (3-5 key points)
- Detailed analysis with code examples
- Actionable recommendations
- Implementation checklist

Use WebSearch for online sources and Grep/Read for codebase analysis."

# Task Worktree: 9d8ed5

**Created**: 2025-10-23 22:00
**Branch**: task/9d8ed5
**Status**: ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

## Task Description

Fix the 404 error on the `/api/docs/list` endpoint in the monitoring dashboard.

**Issue**: The endpoint exists but returns "Documentation directory not found" because path resolution logic uses `Path.cwd()` which points to `/Users/matifuentes/Workspace/agentlab/monitoring` when server runs, but docs are at `/Users/matifuentes/Workspace/agentlab/docs`.

**Root cause**: Server is started from `monitoring/` directory (per deploy.sh), so `Path("docs")` resolves to `monitoring/docs` which doesn't exist.

**Solution**: Use absolute path based on server file location instead of cwd.

## Investigation & Analysis

- Endpoint exists at line 2012 in monitoring/server.py
- Path resolution logic checks if `Path.cwd().name == "telegram_bot"` (legacy pattern)
- Server runs from monitoring/ directory (per deploy.sh line 63)
- Docs directory is at project root: `/Users/matifuentes/Workspace/agentlab/docs`
- Need to use `Path(__file__).parent.parent / "docs"` for absolute path

## Implementation Status

- [x] Analysis complete
- [ ] Solution designed
- [ ] Implementation complete
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Changes committed
- [ ] Merged to main

## Notes & Decisions

- Use `Path(__file__)` to get server file location, then navigate to project root
- Keep error handling for missing docs directory
- Maintain existing response format for frontend compatibility

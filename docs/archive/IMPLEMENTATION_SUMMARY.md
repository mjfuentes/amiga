# Research Worker Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented a new **research_worker** agent that enables a two-phase workflow for code improvements:
1. **Research Phase**: research_worker analyzes code and proposes improvements (no implementation)
2. **Approval Phase**: User reviews proposal and approves/rejects before implementation
3. **Implementation Phase**: code_worker implements only approved changes

This prevents unintended code changes and ensures user control over architectural decisions.

## Agent Responsibilities

### Orchestrator
- **Routes** user requests to appropriate agents
- **Detects** research vs. code vs. Q&A requests
- **Spawns** research_worker or code_worker via Task tool
- **Tracks** proposal state in conversation history
- **Recognizes** approval keywords (looks good, approve, do it, etc.)
- **Displays** proposals and implementation summaries

### Research Worker
- **Analyzes** codebase using Read, Glob, Grep
- **Identifies** improvement opportunities
- **Generates** Markdown proposals with code examples
- **Estimates** effort for each change
- **Prioritizes** recommendations
- **Does NOT implement** - only proposes

### Code Worker
- **Implements** changes from approved proposals
- **Handles** direct coding tasks
- **Modifies** files using Write/Edit
- **Runs** git commands and commits
- **Tests** when applicable
- **Returns** implementation summaries

## Two-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Research & Proposal (Orchestrator → Research Worker)

```
User: "improve the error handling"
    ↓
Orchestrator detects "improve" keyword
    ↓
Spawns research_worker:
  - Analyzes orchestrator.py
  - Finds error handling patterns
  - Generates proposal
    ↓
Research worker returns:
  - Markdown proposal
  - Code examples
  - Effort estimates
    ↓
Orchestrator displays:
  - Full proposal in chat
  - User sees recommendations
  - User can review before approval
```

### Phase 2: Approval & Implementation (Orchestrator → Code Worker)

```
User: "looks good"
    ↓
Orchestrator recognizes approval keyword
    ↓
Spawns code_worker:
  - Receives full proposal as context
  - Implements all changes
  - Commits with message
    ↓
Code worker returns:
  - Implementation summary
  - File changes made
    ↓
Orchestrator displays:
  - "Done. Improved error handling..."
  - User sees what was implemented
  - Git log shows new commit
```

## Key Features

### 1. Read-Only Analysis
- research_worker has no Write/Edit/Bash tools
- Cannot accidentally modify files during analysis
- Safe to run analysis without side effects

### 2. Proposal Format
- Markdown structured format
- Current code examples
- Proposed code examples
- Effort estimates
- Priority/impact ratings
- Risk assessment

### 3. Approval Tracking
- Stored in conversation history
- No database needed (for now)
- Recognized via keywords in user's next message
- Natural conversational flow

### 4. Refined Proposals
- User can request refinement: "good but skip part X"
- Orchestrator can respawn research_worker with refined scope
- Supports iterative improvement before implementation

### 5. Telegram Integration Ready
- Proposals display as formatted Markdown
- Future: Telegram buttons for [Approve][Refine][Reject]
- Future: Persistent proposal storage

## Keywords Detected

### Research Request Triggers
```
improve, refactor, better, optimize, review, suggest, propose,
analyze, enhance, strengthen, design, architecture, performance,
security, quality, logging, testing, refactoring
```

### Approval Keywords
```
approve, approved, looks good, do it, yes, yep, yeah,
go ahead, implement, let's, go for it
```

### Rejection/Refinement Keywords
```
no, no thanks, not needed, too much, skip, smaller,
just X, but skip Y, except, minus
```

## Testing Workflow

### Test Case 1: Research Proposal Generation
```bash
User: "improve the error handling"
Expected:
1. Bot displays Markdown proposal (wait 10-15s)
2. Proposal contains multiple changes
3. Each change has code examples
4. Effort estimates included
5. Priority/impact rated
```

### Test Case 2: Approval → Implementation
```bash
# After proposal displayed:
User: "looks good"
Expected:
1. Code worker spawns (wait 20-30s)
2. Files are modified
3. Git shows new commit
4. Bot sends implementation summary
```

### Test Case 3: Rejection Prevents Implementation
```bash
# After proposal displayed:
User: "no thanks"
Expected:
1. No code worker spawns
2. No files modified
3. Bot acknowledges and moves on
```

### Test Case 4: Refinement Loop
```bash
# After proposal displayed:
User: "good but skip the retry logic"
Expected:
1. Orchestrator recognizes refinement
2. Could offer to respawn with narrower scope
3. User sees updated proposal
4. User can then approve
```

7. **Separation of Concerns**: Three focused agents
8. **Clean Integration**: No changes to core infrastructure needed

## Future Enhancements

1. **Telegram Buttons** - [Approve] [Refine] [Reject] inline buttons
2. **Persistent Proposals** - Store in database with IDs
3. **Diff Visualization** - Show before/after diffs
4. **Multi-Stage Proposals** - Implement in phases
5. **Rollback Support** - Track proposals → commits for easy rollback
6. **Multi-User Approval** - Require multiple stakeholder approvals
7. **Proposal Templates** - Pre-defined proposal types
8. **Analysis Automation** - Scheduled research tasks

## Example Conversation

```
User: "Improve the error handling in orchestrator.py"

Bot:
# Proposal: Improve Error Handling in orchestrator.py

## Summary
Current error handling uses generic Exception catching. Proposal adds retry logic, custom exceptions, and structured logging.

## Current Issues
- Generic Exception catching loses context
- No distinction between error types
- No retry for transient failures
- Minimal logging context

## Proposed Changes

### Change 1: Custom Exception Types (HIGH, 30 min)
...

### Change 2: Retry Logic (HIGH, 45 min)
...

### Change 3: Structured Logging (MEDIUM, 20 min)
...

---

User: "Looks good, implement it"

Bot: Implementing changes...

[code_worker runs]

Bot: Done. Added custom exception types, automatic retry logic for transient failures, and structured logging to error handlers. All error handling now includes full debugging context.

User: Great!
```

## Conclusion

The research_worker implementation provides:

✓ New agent type for analysis without implementation
✓ Two-phase workflow: research → approval → code
✓ User control over architectural decisions
✓ Comprehensive documentation (3 guides + 4 examples)
✓ Proposal tracking via conversation history
✓ Integration with existing orchestrator system
✓ Clear keyword detection for triggering
✓ Ready for Telegram button UI enhancements

The system is fully implemented, documented, and ready for testing and deployment.
